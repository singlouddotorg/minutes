// loads correctly - this is required for Capture, Compile, and Tunebook Editor, all of
// which depend on that shared file being present alongside them, exactly as a real
// browser opening these files directly from disk would see them.
//
// Known limitation, inherited from manual testing throughout this project: jsdom's
// localStorage under a file:// origin is unreliable and often throws. Every affected
// app already treats a failed localStorage write/read as a real, user-facing condition
// (a visible warning) rather than crashing, so tests here work around this the same way
// manual verification did - by checking in-memory state and rendered DOM output, not by
// depending on localStorage actually persisting within a single test run.
// Every JSDOM window created via loadPage() is tracked here so it can be explicitly
// closed. This matters specifically because this suite runs many test files in one
// long-lived `node --test` process - a window's own internal timers and handles don't
// get released just because a test function returns, and left unclosed across enough
// tests in one process, they can stall the whole run. (This never mattered during this
// project's earlier ad-hoc, one-script-per-invocation manual testing, since each script
// exited immediately after running and took everything with it.)
